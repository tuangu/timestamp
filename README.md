# Timestamp Microservice
Demo: (http://aqueous-sands-96599.herokuapp.com/)

#### User Story

+ **User Story:** I can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: January 1, 2016).

+ **User Story:** If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.

+ **User Story:** If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns null for those properties.

```
Example usage:
https://timestamp-ms.herokuapp.com/December%2015,%202015
https://timestamp-ms.herokuapp.com/1450137600
Example output:
{ "unix": 1450137600, "natural": "December 15, 2015" }
```
